# Logic Gates

## Overview

This section covers the design and layout of basic logic gates using Cadence software. This includes NAND, NOR, and OR gates, which are fundamental components in digital circuits and serve as building blocks for more complex logic operations.

## Objective

To design and create the schematic, symbol, and layout for basic logic gates, and to document the design process and results.

## Procedure

1. **Design Logic Gates:**
   - Open Cadence software and create a new project for logic gates.
   - Design the schematic for each type of logic gate (NAND, NOR, OR) using CMOS technology.
   - Create symbols for each logic gate to use in other designs.

2. **Layout Design:**
   - Generate the layout for each logic gate based on the schematic design.
   - Ensure the layout adheres to design rules and optimizes for performance.


## Results

- **NAND Gate:**
  - **Schematic Diagram:** Circuit diagram showing the NAND gate design.

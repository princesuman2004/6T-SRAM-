Presentaion: https://1drv.ms/p/s!AhQL2OKQpwSNiWutqVwenbWirp-5?e=a0B9nf
## Project Objective
Design and analyze a 6T SRAM cell and implement basic in-memory computing techniques. This includes CMOS design and layout of the 6T SRAM cell and logic implementation of AND, OR, and XOR gates within the 6T structure.


## Introduction
This project involves the design and analysis of a 6T SRAM cell, a fundamental building block for memory storage in digital circuits. Additionally, it explores the implementation of basic in-memory computing techniques using the 6T structure to perform logical operations like AND, OR, and XOR.


## Design Details
- **6T SRAM Cell**: Consists of six transistors (4 NMOS and 2 PMOS) configured to store a single bit of data.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Write Circuit**: For writing data to the cell.
  - **Read Circuit**: For reading data from the cell.
  - **Control Signals**: Word line (WL), bit lines (BL and BLB).
- **In-Memory Computing**: Implementation of AND, OR, and XOR gates within the 6T SRAM structure.

## Simulation
Simulations were conducted to verify the functionality and performance of the 6T SRAM cell and the implemented logic gates. The following parameters were considered:
- **Read/Write Stability**
- **Access Time**
- **Power Consumption**
- **Logical Operation Accuracy**

## Results
The simulation results demonstrate the effective functioning of the 6T SRAM cell and the in-memory logic operations.

## Tools Used
- **Cadence Virtuoso**: For schematic design and layout.
- **Mentor Graphics**: For layout design.

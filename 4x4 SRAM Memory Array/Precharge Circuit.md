# Precharge Circuit

## Overview

This document provides the schematic design of a precharge circuit. The precharge circuit is used to set the internal node of a digital logic circuit to a known state, typically high, before accessing or evaluating the logic. This setup is crucial in dynamic logic circuits such as dynamic RAM (DRAM).

## Schematic Design

The schematic design includes the following components and connections:

### Components

1. **Precharge Transistor (PMOS)**
   - **Source:** Connected to Vdd (positive supply voltage).
   - **Gate:** Driven by the precharge control signal.
   - **Drain:** Connected to the node that needs to be precharged.

2. **Access Transistor (NMOS)**
   - **Gate:** Driven by the access control signal.
   - **Source:** Connected to GND (ground).
   - **Drain:** Connected to the same node as the drain of the PMOS transistor.

### Schematic Representation


### Notes

- Ensure that the control signals (`Precharge` and `Access`) are correctly timed to achieve the desired precharge and access operations.
- The precharge circuit is typically used in dynamic logic circuits to ensure that the internal nodes are properly initialized before any logic evaluation.

## Documentation

- **Schematic Diagram:** The schematic diagram shows the arrangement of the PMOS and NMOS transistors, control signals, and connections.

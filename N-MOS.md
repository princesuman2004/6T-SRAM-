## Overview

This section covers my exploration and simulation of NMOS (N-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) transistors using Cadence software. NMOS transistors are fundamental building blocks in digital circuits, and understanding their behavior is crucial for effective electronic design.

## Objective

To study and understand the characteristics and behavior of NMOS transistors under various operating conditions, and to document the findings through detailed simulations.

## Procedure

1. **Setup NMOS Simulation:**
   - Open Cadence software and create a new project for NMOS simulations.
   - Design the NMOS transistor circuit in the schematic editor.

2. **Define Parameters:**
   - Set up the transistor model parameters such as threshold voltage, gate-source voltage, and drain-source voltage.
   - Configure the simulation settings for DC analyses.

3. **Run Simulations:**
   - Perform DC analysis to examine the DC operating point and Id-Vgs characteristics.
     
4. **Collect Data:**
   - Record key parameters such as threshold voltage, transconductance, drain current, and output resistance.
   - Gather simulation waveforms and performance metrics.
  

5. **Analyze Results:**
   - Compare simulation results with theoretical expectations.
   - Interpret the behavior of NMOS transistors under different voltage and current conditions.

## Results

- **DC Analysis:**
  - **Threshold Voltage (Vth):** The voltage at which the NMOS transistor begins to conduct.
  - **Drain Current (Id) vs. Gate-Source Voltage (Vgs):** Plot illustrating the relationship between Id and Vgs.
